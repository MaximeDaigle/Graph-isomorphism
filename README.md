# Graph-isomorphism
Determine if two graphs are isomorphic with a backtracking algorithm

G and H represent the same graph if and only if a permutation σ of the set {1, 2, . . . , m} exists such that for all i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}, G(i, j) = H(σ(i), σ(j)).

>The graph isomorphism problem is one of few standard problems in computational complexity theory belonging to NP

> Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
